# 📊 Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my **Data Analysis Portfolio**, a curated collection of my projects showcasing my skills across **Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau**. This repo is more than raw files—it’s a reflection of how I grow through data, from messy spreadsheets to clear, insightful stories.

## 🚀 About This Repository

Inside, you'll find the tools and techniques I’ve used to:

- Explore real-world datasets  
- Clean, transform, and analyze data using Excel formulas, SQL queries, and Python scripts  
- Build compelling visualizations in Tableau (and sometimes in Python)  
- Highlight key findings via narratives, visuals, or dashboards  

Each tool has its own space:

- **Excel**: Dashboards, pivot tables, advanced formulas—done right.  
- **SQL**: Smart queries, schema exploration, data wrangling, and optimized solutions.  
- **Python**: Data munging, analysis, and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
- **Tableau**: Interactive visual stories that invite exploration.  


## 🎯 Why This Matters

This portfolio shines a light on what I can do:

- Work confidently across Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau  
- Tackle unstructured problems with analytical methods  
- Communicate effectively through visuals and clear explanations  

Whether you’re a fellow data enthusiast, a recruiter, or just curious—you're welcome to explore, fork, or reach out!
